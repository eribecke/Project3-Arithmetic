# Project3-Arithmetic

This app is an arithmetic problem generator. The user can choose from a list of difficulties and operations to practice specific kinds of math problems.
There are three different tabs: the menu tab, the problem tab, and the results tab.
The user can also select what type of operation they want the problems to use (+, -, x, /) and they can choose the number of problems they want to solve. (The Project 4 branch is an upgraded version of this app.)


## Functionality 

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ ] User sees options for difficulty and opertations, as well as incrementors/decrementors for choosing the number of problems.
* [ ] User can push start button to go to the next screen and solve math problems.
* [ ] User sees generated problems based off what they selected on the previous screen.
* [ ] User can enter their answers to each problem and push the done button to submit them.
* [ ] User will be taken to the results screen if they push the done button after the last problem.
* [ ] User will see their results (number of problems correct/total number of problems) on the next screen.
* [ ] User can push the "Do it again" button and be taken back to the menu screen

## Notes

My greatest challenge was dealing with launch issues while trying to use fragments. I was not able to resolve this issue, so I switched to using Intent to navigate and pass information between screens.
